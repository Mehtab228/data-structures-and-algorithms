-Binary Tree
1. preorder() traverses the tree from root >> left >> right and returns the traversal as an array of values

2. inorder() traverses the tree from left >> root >> right and returns the traversal as an array of values

3. postorder() traverses the tree from left >> right >> root and returns the traversal as an array of values

Binary Search Tree:

-An interface called comparable was imported to help compare the values of generics. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.

1. add() adds any value and a node with that value is created. The node is placed in the appropriate location within the tree according to a binary sort. If the value is already present, no change is made.

2. contains() performs a binary search, looking for a node that contains value. returns a boolean based on result.
